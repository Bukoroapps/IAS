          <p class="lead">Information assurance and security professionals need to have an understanding of the progression and use of data within organizations in order to assist with designing and implementing appropriate business systems. Traditional business systems can include databases, networks, and applications.</p>
		  <p class="lead">Security professionals will be called on to solve security and data-retrieval issues, as well as help with computer system design and networking. They may be expected to maintain disaster-recovery plans, which copy data into storage backup files that are located outside the IT network.</p>
		  <p class="lead">Because cybersecurity ties directly to the discipline of computer science and information technology, individuals will typically need a strong technology background or interest in information systems to pursue a cybersecurity profession. Experience with computer science; information technology; research and development; the completion of security certifications; and consulting activities can all help build a career in cybersecurity.</p>

<p class="lead">Image result for Design principles (defense in depth)
Defense in Depth (DiD) is an approach to cybersecurity in which a series of defensive mechanisms are layered in order to protect valuable data and information. If one mechanism fails, another steps up immediately to thwart an attack.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>System/security life-cycle</strong></p>
<p class="lead">The cycle consists of a number of phases including systems investigation, systems analysis , logical design, physical design, implementation and maintenance and testing. Once implementation is done, the security of the system and data, depend on the maintenance and testing phase which spans the life of the project.</p>

          <h2>Security implementation mechanisms</h2>
<p class="lead"><strong>Gates, guards, guns; cryptography</strong></p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Gates</strong></p>
<p class="lead">An AND gate is an electrical circuit that combines two signals so that the output is on if both signals are present. An AND gate is an electrical circuit that combines two signals so that the output is on if both signals are present.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Guards</strong></p>
<p class="lead">In information security, a guard is a device or system for allowing computers on otherwise separate networks to communicate, subject to configured constraints. ... Further, unlike a firewall a guard provides assurance that it is effective in providing this control even under attack and failure conditions.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Guns</strong></p>
<p class="lead">[GUN P2P Encryption] Gun is a realtime, decentralized, offline-first, graph database engine. GUN works peer-to-peer by design, meaning you have no centralized database server to maintain or that could crash. It allows to build decentralized, federated, or centralized apps.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Information assurance analysis model</strong></p>
<p class="lead">Information Assurance (IA) model is an extension of the original 1991 McCumber INFOSEC Model expanding coverage, responsibilities and accountability of security professionals and also establishes an additional view of the states of information.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>MSR model*; threats; vulnerabilities; attacks; countermeasures</strong></p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Threat</strong></p>
<p class="lead">In Information Security threats can be many like Software attacks, theft of intellectual property, identity theft, theft of equipment or information, sabotage, and information extortion.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Vulnerabilities</strong></p>
<p class="lead">In cyber security, a vulnerability is a weakness which can be exploited by a cyber attack to gain unauthorized access to or perform unauthorized actions on a computer system. Vulnerabilities can allow attackers to run code, access a system's memory, install malware, and steal, destroy or modify sensitive data.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Attacks</strong></p>
<p class="lead">A network attack is an attempt to gain unauthorized access to an organization's network, with the objective of stealing data or perform other malicious activity. Active: Attackers not only gain unauthorized access but also modify data, either deleting, encrypting or otherwise harming it.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Countermeasures</strong></p>
<p class="lead">In computer security a countermeasure is an action, device, procedure, or technique that reduces a threat, a vulnerability, or an attack by eliminating or preventing it, by minimizing the harm it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be taken.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Disaster recovery (natural and man-made)</strong></p>
<p class="lead"><strong>A disaster is classified in two broad groupings:</strong></p>
<p class="lead">Natural Disasters – Floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, and hurricanes.</p>
<p class="lead">Man-made Disasters – Failed changes to systems, infrastructure damage, hardware failure, file deletion etc.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Forensics</strong></p>
<p class="lead">They're the people who collect, process, preserve, and analyze computer-related evidence. They help identify network vulnerabilities and then develop ways to mitigate them.</p>

<h2>Security Mechanisms (Countermeasures)</h2>


<p class="lead"><strong>Cryptography</strong></p>
<p class="lead">Cryptography is associated with the process of converting ordinary plain text into unintelligible text and vice-versa. It is a method of storing and transmitting data in a particular form so that only those for whom it is intended can read and process it.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Cryptosystems</strong></p>
<p class="lead">A cryptosystem is an implementation of cryptographic techniques and their accompanying infrastructure to provide information security services. A cryptosystem is also referred to as a cipher system. Let us discuss a simple model of a cryptosystem that provides confidentiality to the information being transmitted.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Keys: symmetric & asymmetric</strong></p>
<p class="lead">Only one key (symmetric key) is used, and the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the message. Two different cryptographic keys (asymmetric keys), called the public and the private keys, are used for encryption and decryption.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Performance (software/hardware)</strong></p>
<p class="lead">In software quality assurance, performance testing is in general a testing practice performed to determine how a system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a particular workload.</p>
<p class="lead">In computers, hardware performance counters, or hardware counters are a set of special-purpose registers built into modern microprocessors to store the counts of hardware-related activities within computer systems. Advanced users often rely on those counters to conduct low-level performance analysis or tuning.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Implementation</strong></p>
<p class="lead">Establish a range of security controls to protect assets residing on systems and networks. Consider use of access controls at your network, and use of data encryption technologies (VPN too) as required.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Authentication</strong></p>
<p class="lead">It is security service that is designed to establish validity of transmission of message by verification of individual’s identity to receive specific category of information. To ensure availability of various single factors and multi-factor authentication methods are used. A single factor authentication method uses single parameter to verify users’ identity whereas two-factor authentication uses multiple factors to verify user’s identity.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Bio-authentication (use of biometrics)</strong></p>
<p class="lead">Biometric authentication is a security process that relies on the unique biological characteristics of an individual to verify that he is who is says he is. Typically, biometric authentication is used to manage access to physical and digital resources such as buildings, rooms and computing devices.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Redundancy</strong></p>
<p class="lead">Redundancy is an engineering term which means “the duplication of critical components or functions of a system with the intention of increasing reliability of the system, usually in the form of a backup or fail-safe, or to improve actual system performance”</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Intrusion detection</strong></p>
<p class="lead">Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are automated systems that monitor and analyze network traffic and generate "alerts" in response to activity that either match known patterns of malicious activities or is unusual. IDS can be either network or host-based.</p>

          <h2>Operational Issues</h2>
<p class="lead"><strong>Trends</strong></p>
<p class="lead">Technology is evolving rapidly and changing the way businesses operate. Emerging technologies such as cloud computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), automation, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are creating unprecedented opportunities for businesses to unlock new value.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Auditing</strong></p>
<p class="lead">A security audit is the high-level description of the many ways organizations can test and assess their overall security posture, including cybersecurity. You might employ more than one type of security audit to achieve your desired results and meet your business objectives.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Cost / benefit analysis</strong></p>
<p class="lead">CBA is a method used to evaluate competing projects by comparing each project's costs with its benefits. CBA is one of the most popular methods for evaluating projects because it reduces the evaluation complexity of each project to a single figure.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Asset management</strong></p>
<p class="lead">Asset Assurance is a new and exciting discipline which is garnering significant interest as CSPs turn their attention to managing and reducing capex. A complete programme of Asset Assurance encompasses continual monitoring and process controls at each phase of the asset lifecycle.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Standards</strong></p>
<p class="lead">A standard is a repeatable, harmonised, agreed and documented way of doing something. Standards contain technical specifications or other precise criteria designed to be used consistently as a rule, guideline, or definition.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Enforcement</strong></p>
<p class="lead">Enforcement is the process of ensuring compliance with laws, regulations, rules, standards, and social norms. Governments attempt to effectuate successful implementation of policies by enforcing laws and regulations.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Legal issues</strong></p>
<p class="lead">Legal issue or issue of law is a legal question which is the foundation of a case. It requires a court's decision. It can also refer to a point on which the evidence is undisputed, the outcome of which depends on the court's interpretation of the law.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Disaster recovery (natural and man-made)</strong></p>
<p class="lead">Disaster recovery, or disaster recovery plans, involve a specific set of procedures and policies that are put in place to enable the continuation of vital business processes after a natural or man-made disaster. Disaster recovery plans tend to focus on the restoration of IT and technology systems that support critical business function.</p>

<h2>Policy</h2>

<p class="lead"><strong>Creation of policies</strong></p>
<p class="lead">An information security policy is a set of rules enacted by an organization to ensure that all users of networks or the IT structure within the organization's domain abide by the prescriptions regarding the security of data stored digitally within the boundaries the organization stretches its authority.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Maintenance of policies</strong></p>
<p class="lead">It requires ongoing maintenance and continual improvement, which ensures that policies and procedures are kept up to date, resulting in better protection for your sensitive information.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Prevention</strong></p>
<p class="lead">Preventing an incident requires careful analysis and planning. Information is an asset that requires protection commensurate with its value. Security measures must be taken to protect information from unauthorized modification, destruction, or disclosure whether accidental or intentional.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Avoidance</strong></p>
<p class="lead">Risk avoidance involves taking specific actions to eliminate or significantly modify the process or activities that are the basis for the risk.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Incident response (forensics)</strong></p>
<p class="lead">Incident response is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack, also known as an IT incident, computer incident or security incident. The goal is to handle the situation in a way that limits damage and reduces recovery time and costs.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Domain integration (physical, network, internet)</strong></p>
<p class="lead">Physical Domain</p>
<p class="lead">The physical domain covers the development of physical changes, which includes growing in size and strength, as well as the development of both gross motor skills and fine motor skills. </p>
<p class="lead">Network Domain</p>
<p class="lead">A network domain is an administrative grouping of multiple private computer networks or hosts within the same infrastructure. Domains can be identified using a domain name; domains which need to be accessible from the public Internet can be assigned a globally unique name within the Domain Name System (DNS).</p>
<p class="lead">Internet Domain</p>
<p class="lead">An Internet domain is a collection of data describing a self-contained administrative and technical unit on the Internet, according to the principles of the DNS system. Global visibility of an Internet domain is provided for by the DNS service.</p>

<p class="lead">5. Explain why a password policy might need to be modified due to changing circumstances.</p>
<p class="lead">6. Explain why security policies must consider all aspects of an organization in order to be effective.</p>
<p class="lead">7. Give an example of how vulnerability in one area of an organization might enable a compromise in
another area. </p>
<p>(Example: weak physical security allows sniffer access to the LAN which allows a
password to be read from a POP3 packet. The password is used to gain access to a corporate server.</p>

<p>Login access to the server allows a root-kit to be applied and the bad guy has total access to the
server).</p>

<p class="lead">8. Describe a situation in which an incident would require a full forensic approach including evidence

<h2>Attacks</h2>
<p class="lead"><strong>Social engineering</strong></p>
<p class="lead">Social engineering uses psychological manipulation to trick users into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Denial of service</strong></p>
<p class="lead">A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users. The concept is to send more traffic to a network address than the programmers have built the system to handle.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Protocol attacks</strong></p>
<p class="lead">A User Datagram Protocol (UDP) attack is generated from a node with the IP address 192.168. 1.20 to a node with the IP address 192.168. 1.22. Snort is used to detect a possible attack. Snort's detect engine uses one of the files in DOS under directory rules to generate the alert file alert.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Active attacks</strong></p>
<p class="lead">An active attack involves using information gathered during a passive attack to compromise a user or network. There are many types of active attacks. In a masquerade attack, an intruder will pretend to be another user to gain access to the restricted area in the system.</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Passive attacks</strong></p>
<p class="lead">A passive attack is a network attack in which a system is monitored and sometimes scanned for open ports and vulnerabilities. The purpose is solely to gain information about the target and no data is changed on the target. Passive attacks include active reconnaissance and passive reconnaissance.</p>
